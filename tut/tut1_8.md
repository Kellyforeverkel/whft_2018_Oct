# Tutorial 1.8

You are asked to design a horizontal axis wind turbine with 8 MW rated output.

By showing detailed design calculation, provide the following design parameters for the wind turbines:

1. Minimum rotor diameter
1. Minimum rotor hub height

State all your assumption.

## Solution (Write your solution here).
P= (1/2)(CpP)(V^3)(A) W
Cp= 16/27 = 0.593
